1. What Was Done to Implement the Map
OpenStreetMap:

OpenStreetMap is a free and open-source map service. It does not require an API key, unlike Google Maps.
The map tiles are loaded using the TileLayer component from react-leaflet.
React-Leaflet:

The react-leaflet library is used to integrate OpenStreetMap into your React application.
Components like MapContainer, TileLayer, Marker, and Popup are used to render the map and markers.
Geolocation API:

The browser's built-in Geolocation API (navigator.geolocation) is used to fetch the user's current location dynamically.
If the user denies location access or the browser does not support geolocation, a fallback location (e.g., Delhi) is used.
Custom Icons:

Custom icons for the user and vehicles are created using the L.Icon class from the leaflet library.



What we have use to implement this API:
